# Commenting System

A dynamic, interactive commenting system built with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. This project allows users to add, reply, edit, and delete comments in a structured and user-friendly format.

## Features

1. **Add a Comment**: Users can add a new comment by entering their username and comment text. A "Please enter a username and a comment." message appears if either field is empty.

2. **Reply to a Comment**: Users can reply to any comment by clicking the "Reply" button. Upon clicking, input fields appear to enter the reply's username and message. Replies are nested under the parent comment, creating a threaded structure.

3. **Edit a Comment or Reply**: Comments and replies can be edited by clicking the "Edit" button. This changes the text into an editable field with a "Save" button to save the updated text.

4. **Delete a Comment or Reply**: Users can delete any comment or reply by clicking the "Delete" button. Deleting a comment removes it along with all nested replies.

5. **Reset Comments**: A "Reset" button clears all comments and replies from the page, restoring the interface to its initial state.

### Styling

This project uses **Tailwind CSS** for styling components, including comment cards, buttons, and input fields. Tailwind’s utility classes ensure each element is well-aligned, responsive, and user-friendly, allowing for rapid customization and a clean, consistent interface.

- **Comment Card**: Each comment or reply card is styled with Tailwind utility classes such as `bg-white`, `p-4`, `rounded-lg`, and `shadow-md` to create a visually appealing, card-like layout that is easy to read and interact with.

- **Buttons**: Buttons like Reply, Edit, Save, Cancel, and Delete utilize classes like `bg-blue-500`, `text-white`, `px-4`, `py-2`, `rounded-full`, and `hover:bg-blue-600` for a consistent look and feel across the application, enhancing interactivity with color and hover effects.

- **Input Fields**: Input fields for adding or editing comments/replies use Tailwind classes such as `w-full`, `p-3`, `border`, `border-gray-300`, and `rounded-lg` to maintain consistency and usability, ensuring a clean and spacious area for text input.

Tailwind’s responsive utility classes also ensure that the UI maintains its structure and readability on various screen sizes.
